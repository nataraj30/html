<h1>C (programming language)</h1>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language </p>
<p>Supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion</p>
<p>While a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</p>
<p>By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions</p>
<p>Therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language</p>
<p>Various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
<h2>Program to Display Hello World</h2>

<p>printf("Hello World")</p>
<p>return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
